Time domain:
* Gives the behavior of signal over time.
* Examples: Sinusoids over time,Bitcoin value graph over time

Frequency domain:
* Gives the idea about various frequency components present in the signal.
* Can be of great use while filtering,mixing and amplification (?).
* Examples: Spectral diagram

What can be used when?

If we want to create a complex wave,it can be created using the sum of mutiple sinusoidal waves (Fourier transform) of different frquency.
Analysis in frequency domain can be very useful in such cases. (frequency domain)

If we want to filter out certain frequency components,we can get a spectral diagram of the signal to identify the frequencies that we want and the ones that we dont want.
Further it can be usefull in designing the filter (frequency domain)

If we are interested in getting the value of a component at any time(there can be a limit).(time domain)
