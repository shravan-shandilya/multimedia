Signals:
* function of one or more varibales(independent varibles)that contain some information
  * independent variables can be time ( spech signal over time)
  * Images: brightness over horizontal and veritcal points (independent variable)
*types: 
  * continuous
  * discrete

Systems:
* used for processing signals
* types
  * linear, non linear
  * time invariant,time variant


Connecting multiple systems:
* Series
* Parallel
* Feedback
